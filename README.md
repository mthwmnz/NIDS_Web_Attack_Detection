# NIDS_Web_Attack_Detection
Implemented a high-performance NIDS pipeline using PyCaret/LightGBM. Successfully handled 456K+ imbalanced network flows (CIC-IDS2017) with SMOTE and CPU parallelism for accelerated training. Final model achieved $0.9974$ F1 Score, demonstrating near-perfect attack detection while minimizing false positives.
